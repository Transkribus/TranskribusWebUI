= Transkribus Web UI =

https://read02.uibk.ac.at/wiki/index.php/WebUI_spec (READ login required, excuse the dodgy table format)

Initial rework of TSX (https://github.com/Transkribus/TSX) for the READ project (http://read.transkribus.eu)

This project uses python django (https://www.djangoproject.com/)

So far this is a skeletal website to aid design discussion about the architechture of the WebUI. The basic idea is that the project will have 3 apps for each of the three modules described in the specification 

- Base module (working title library)
- Publishing module
- Modification module

Though possibly more apps for smaller bits of functioanilty...
