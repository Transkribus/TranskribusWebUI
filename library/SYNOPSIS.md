# Synopsis of Transkribus library

This document assesses how the transkribus document structure is traversed by the Transkribus WebUI (aka Transkribus Library). The purpose is elucidation for other partners, but also to identify bottlenecks and other potential inefficiencies.

## Approach

The Transkribus document structure with which we are concerned encompasses the list collections accessible by a given user all the way down to single word item and everythign in between. The Library website in it's current form is a demonstrator of how that structure can be traversed statelessly, using URIs.

In essence we have a view per level (ie collection, document, page, transcript, region, line, word) each with the metadata for that object and a list of child objects. A list of sibling objects is also used to build a navigation interface (up, next, prev). The data is drawn exclusively from the transkribus [REST service](https://transkribus.eu/wiki/index.php/REST_Interface), but as you will see there is some post processing down before we can complete the traversal.

In some cases the views may be a bit overloaded, but we hope they prove a useful illustration of what is needed to access all and each of the elements of the transkribus data with single requests.

The overall aim is to provide the maximum *necessary* data in the simplest possible way so that the various clients can access, use and update the resources provided by the Transkribus service.

## Tech

The django-python framework is used, and although not presently in the ideal state the aim is to build up a core of functionality within the project such that client apps can be added within the framework to help realise the pink bit of this [https://read02.uibk.ac.at/wiki/images/6/6b/Interfaces_Map.pdf](Interfaces Map). 

As things stand everything is stuffed in a single app called "library". Below we describe each of the components, what they are for and `#TODO provide profiling data for each view for analysis`.


## Views

#### library/collections

Displays the list of collections for the authenticated user. As collections are cached by `services.t_login_required` we just fetch that data from the cache and send to template.

#### library/collection/{collId}

Displays the collection specified by {collId} and lists the documents *and* the page thumbnails, in that collection. 
Uses `services.t_collection` to collect `colList`, a list of documents (JSON) for given {collId}

* REST call: `settings.TRP_URL/collections/{collId}/list`

As there is currently no transkribus call that returns data for a single collection by ID (eg collection/{collId}). So we loop through the `collections` data (from cache) and pick out collection level metadata from there. The same could be achieved using the list of documents (ie pick first/random document data from `colList` which has collection data in it too). This may be a preferable approach, especially if there are lots of collections to loop through. A single call to retrieve collection level metadata seems to make more sense, but as we have a list of collections and a list of documents that have the necessary data in them, it may be a surplus request to the WS which we would want to avoid.

Then nav object is built from `collections` data.

Then we fetch thumbnails for each page in a document (overkill?). To do this loop through the documents (from `colList`) and for each document get the fulldoc data.

REST call: `settings.TRP_URL/collections/{collId}/{docId}/fulldoc?nrOfTranscripts=0`

This is done only to retrieve the imgFileName for thumbnails, no transcripts.

#### library/document/{collId}/{docId}

Displays the document specified by {docId} and lists the pages in that document.

`services.t_collection` for list of docs for nav object
`services.t_document`  which returns doc metadata and all transcripts

* REST call: `settings.TRP_URL/collections/{collId}/{docId}/fulldoc?nrOfTranscripts=-1`

#### library/page/{collId}/{docId}/{pageNr}

Displays the page specified by {pageNr} and lists the transcripts for that page we are delaing almost exlusively with data from fulldoc here.

`services.t_document` for all pages (for nav) and all transcripts (for list). 

* REST call: `settings.TRP_URL/collections/{collId}/{docId}/fulldoc?nrOfTranscripts=-1`

Page level metadata extracted with equiv of  `//pageList/pages/index(pageNr-1)`. I'd be more comfortable with an abitrary ID for pages rather than the page position.

Transcripts are extracted with equiv of `//trList/transcripts`

Sibling pages with equiv of `//pageList/pages` for nav

#### library/transcript/{collId}/{docId}/{pageNr}/{transId}

Displays the transcript specified by {transId} and lists the regions of text for that transcript.

`services.t_page` which returns a list of transcripts that what we get from `collections/{collId}/{docId}/{pageNr}/list` this is used for nav, but also loops through to match the {transId}, extract the pageXML url and request that using `services.t_transcript`.

* REST call: `settings.TRP_URL/collections/{collId}/{docId}/{pageNr}/list`

`services.t_transcript` gives us the pageXML with a request to the file server and from there the child regions are extracted for the list.

* File server call: `https://dbis-thidre.uibk.ac.at/f/Get?id=....`

#### library/region/{collId}/{docId}/{pageNr}/{transId}/{regionId}

Displays the region specified by {regionId} and lists the lines of text for that region.

Calls `services.t_page` to which returns a list of transcripts and from this the pageXML url is extracted.

Calls `services.t_document` to get the fulldoc (!) from whence it extraces pagedata from `//pagesList/pages/index(pageNr-1)` the pagedata is *only* used to access the image url.

With the pageXML extracted from the `services.t_page` call it then fetches the pageXML with `services.t_transcript` with which it can start parsing out data on the region and thei child lines if available.

#### library/line/{collId}/{docId}/{pageNr}/{transId}/{regionId}/{lineId}

As above this needs to call `services.t_documnet` for the fulldoc to extract the pagedata to get the image URL, `services.t_page` to get the transcirpt data which has the pageXML url and `services.t_transcript` for the pageXML from which it can parse out the regions (for the nav), line level metadata and the child words if available.

Displays the line specified by {lineId} and lists the words for that line.

#### library/word/{collId}/{docId}/{pageNr}/{transId}/{regionId}/{lineId}/{wordId}

Displays the word specified by {wordId}. A single word, and the data associated with it as extraced from the hard won pageXML.

It is the very apex of bonkers by this point. I'm sure we can do this a bit more efficiently.

## Extensions of django 

#### library/backends.py/TranskribusBackend/authenticate

Class to override user authrntication, effectively out-sourcing it to the Transkribus web service. The default django user object is extended to store some additional user data from the web service. For django apps using this there is the potential here to combine the user of transkribus as the authentication authority *and* further extend the user object to include useful app related user data (eg crowd-sourcing rewards/badges etc)

#### library/decorators.py/t_login_required

Version of django @login_required decorator and is applied to any view that requires authentication. This extends default functionality by adding a call to t_services.collections so that the list of permissable collections is available for any logged in user.

## services

We are almost exclusively using the transkribus REST service, for our backend and the services contain our interfaces to that.
